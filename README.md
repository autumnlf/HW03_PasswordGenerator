## Description
In this assignment I was tasked with creating a password generator using Java Script. I was given starter code that included finished HTML and CSS, but only a few lines of JS.

*   Given Site:
    
    ![site to recreate](./Assets/03-javascript-homework-demo.png)

    The 'Generate Password' button is not yet functional with the starter code.

After adding to JS code, the site now give pop-up prompts for generating a password; including:

*   Entering password length
*   Including uppercase letters
*   Including lowercase letters
*   Including special characters
*   Including numbers
